<p><b>What is GSAT satellites?</b></br>
The GSAT(GeosynchronosSatellite)are India”S indigenously developed communications satellites,used for digital audio,data and video brocasting.</br>

<b> What is the use of GSAT Satellites?</b></br>
GSAT Satellites are communications satellites developed in India that are used for digital audio data and video broadcasting.</br>
ISRO developed the GSAT series of geosynchronous satellites with the goal of making India self-sufficient in broadcasting services.</br>

<p><b>How do these satellites help in weather forecasting?</b></br>
These Weather Satellites are an important observational tool for all scales of NWS forecasting operations.</br>
 Satellite data, having a global view, complements land-based systems such as radiosondes, weather radars, and surface observing systems. </br>
There are two types of weather satellites: polar orbiting and geostationary.</br>

<p><b>How do satellites help with disaster management?</b></br>
How satellites play a role in disaster relief - Viasat</b></br>
-Satellites enable communication during disasters when terrestrial infrastructure is down or over capacity. Satellite internet is</br>
 critical to facilitating first response efforts by keeping airports, shelter locations, healthcare facilities, and utility operations up and running.31 Aug 2023</br>

<p><b>How do satellites help in navigation?</b></br>
Satellite Navigation - GPS - How It Works | Federal Aviation ...</b></br>
To accomplish this, each of the 31 satellites emits signals that enable receivers through a combination of signals from at least four satellites,</br>
 to determine their location and time. GPS satellites carry atomic clocks that provide extremely accurate time.</br>
